# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  VDO messages (AIS Type 4 - Base Station Reports) were not being processed correctly. 
  Position data from Type 4 messages was not being extracted and stored, preventing VDO 
  targets and their range circles from appearing on the map.
  
  Sample VDO message for testing: !ABVDO,1,1,,B,4>kvmbiuHO969Rvgn<:CUW?P0<0m,0*4D

          Fixed AIS Type 4 message processing:
          1. Separated Type 4 handling from Type 1-3 messages
          2. Type 4 messages now extract correct fields (lat, lon, accuracy, epfd, raim)
          3. Added is_base_station flag to vessels collection
          4. Only stores positions if lat/lon are not None

          ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED - ALL CRITICAL TESTS PASSED
          
          Test Results:
          - ✅ API Connection: Working
          - ✅ Database Clear: Working  
          - ✅ File Upload: Successfully processed VDO message
          - ✅ Message Storage: MMSI 994031019 stored correctly
          - ✅ Position Storage: Lat 18.01114, Lon 41.66945 stored with is_vdo: true
          - ✅ Base Station Flag: Vessel correctly marked as is_base_station: true
          - ✅ Active Vessels: Base station appears correctly in /api/vessels/active
          - ✅ Backend Logs: No errors, successful processing logged
          
          Type 4 message processing is working perfectly. The fix correctly:
          1. Separates Type 4 from Type 1-3 message handling
          2. Extracts position data (lat/lon) from Type 4 messages
          3. Marks vessels as base stations (is_base_station: true)
          4. Stores positions with is_vdo: true flag
          5. Makes base stations visible in active vessels endpoint

          Fixed VDO detection logic:
          - Previous: Checked for '!AIVDO' or '$AIVDO' prefix
          - Now: Checks for 'VDO' in first 10 characters
          - This handles all VDO formats like !ABVDO, !AIVDO, $ABVDO, etc.
          Line changed: 285-287 in server.py
          Tested with sample message: !ABVDO,1,1,,B,4>kvmbiuHO969Rvgn<:CUW?P0<0m,0*4D

          ✅ VDO DETECTION WORKING PERFECTLY
          
          Tested multiple VDO formats:
          - !ABVDO - ✅ Detected correctly
          - !AIVDO - ✅ Detected correctly  
          - $ABVDO - ✅ Detected correctly
          - $AIVDO - ✅ Detected correctly
          
          All 4 test messages processed successfully:
          - 4 messages uploaded with 0 errors
          - 1 base station vessel created
          - 4 VDO data entries generated
          - All marked with is_vdo: true flag
          
          The new detection logic ('VDO' in first 10 characters) works for all VDO formats as intended.

          ✅ VDO BLUE SQUARE MARKERS WORKING PERFECTLY
          
          Test Results:
          - ✅ Fixed React import error (added missing React import)
          - ✅ Fixed base station detection (updated isBaseStation function to check is_base_station flag)
          - ✅ Blue square markers: 16 VDO markers displayed correctly on map
          - ✅ VDO popup: Clicking markers opens popup with correct information (MMSI, source, spoof limit)
          - ✅ Base station designation: Vessel info panel shows "Base Station" label
          - ✅ Map navigation: Correctly zooms to VDO position (18.01114, 41.66945)
          - ✅ Search integration: VDO vessel appears in search results
          
          VDO markers are correctly rendered as blue squares and fully functional.

          Test Results:
          - ✅ Fixed range circle rendering (changed from radius_km to spoof_limit_km)
          - ✅ Fixed VDO data loading (updated search function to load VDO data)
          - ✅ Pink range circles: 11 circles displayed correctly around VDO positions
          - ✅ Circle radius: 50km spoof detection range properly visualized
          - ✅ Circle styling: Pink color (#ec4899) with transparent fill
          - ✅ Multiple VDO support: Handles multiple VDO positions from different sources
          
          Pink range circles are correctly drawn around VDO positions showing spoof detection range.

      Fixed two critical issues:
      
      1. Type 4 Message Processing:
         - Separated Type 4 (Base Station Report) from Type 1-3 (Position Reports)
         - Type 4 has different fields: lat, lon, accuracy, epfd, raim
         - Does NOT have: speed, course, heading, nav_status
         - Added is_base_station flag to mark base stations
      
      2. VDO Detection:
         - Fixed to detect VDO in any format (!ABVDO, !AIVDO, $ABVDO, etc.)
         - Changed from prefix check to searching for 'VDO' in first 10 chars
      
      Sample VDO message for testing:
      !ABVDO,1,1,,B,4>kvmbiuHO969Rvgn<:CUW?P0<0m,0*4D
      
      This decodes to:
      - MMSI: 994031019
      - Type: 4 (Base Station Report)
      - Lat: 18.01114
      - Lon: 41.66945
      
      Backend has been restarted and is running.
      
      Testing needed:
      1. Upload or stream the sample VDO message
      2. Verify it's stored in positions collection
      3. Verify blue square marker appears on map
      4. Verify pink range circle is calculated and displayed
      5. Check spoof detection logic works correctly
