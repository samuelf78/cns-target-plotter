# CNS SYSTEMS TARGET PLOTTER - COPY/PASTE INSTALLATION

Since you can't download files directly, follow these steps to create everything manually:

## PART 1: CREATE FOLDER STRUCTURE

1. Open File Explorer (Windows Key + E)
2. Go to C:\ drive
3. Right-click → New → Folder
4. Name it: `cns-target-plotter`
5. Open that folder
6. Create these folders inside:
   - `backend`
   - `frontend`
   - Inside frontend, create: `src`
   - Inside src, create: `components`
   - Inside components, create: `ui`
   - Inside src, create: `hooks`
   - Inside frontend, create: `public`

Final structure should look like:
```
C:\cns-target-plotter\
├── backend\
└── frontend\
    ├── public\
    └── src\
        ├── components\
        │   └── ui\
        └── hooks\
```

## PART 2: I'LL PROVIDE EACH FILE

I'll give you each file's contents in separate messages.
You'll copy and paste each one into a new file.

Here's how to create each file:
1. Open Notepad (Start → type "notepad")
2. Copy the content I provide
3. Paste into Notepad
4. Save with the exact filename I specify
5. Make sure to save in the correct folder

## FILES YOU'LL NEED TO CREATE:

**Backend files (4 files):**
1. `C:\cns-target-plotter\backend\server.py` (main program)
2. `C:\cns-target-plotter\backend\requirements.txt` (Python packages)
3. `C:\cns-target-plotter\backend\.env` (configuration)
4. `C:\cns-target-plotter\backend\start.bat` (startup script)

**Frontend files (8 main files + UI components):**
1. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\package.json`
2. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\.env`
3. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\tailwind.config.js`
4. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\postcss.config.js`
5. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\src\App.js`
6. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\src\App.css`
7. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\src\index.js`
8. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\src\index.css`
9. `C:\cns-target-plotter\frontend\public\index.html`
10. UI component files (I'll provide a simpler approach)
