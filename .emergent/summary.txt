The AI engineer's work involved incrementally enhancing a nautical AIS/NMEA application. Initially, core functionalities like data streaming, MongoDB integration, React/FastAPI structure, and UI were established. Over time, significant features were added, including comprehensive position validation, advanced  export, and refined target management with geographic and vessel limiting. Performance was optimized via canvas rendering and marker clustering.

Recent development focused on AIS data interpretation (dynamic vessel icons, N/A for invalid headings, SAR target icons) and substantial UI/UX improvements (collapsible sidebar, dynamic trail loading, map interaction fixes). A major feature, the temporal playback slider for historical vessel positions, was implemented and subsequently debugged for zoom and multi-vessel rendering issues.

The most recent phase involved a proposed migration from MongoDB to SQLite for a Windows native executable, which was then deferred. Instead, the focus shifted to integrating the MarineISA API for automatic vessel data enrichment. The AI engineer successfully implemented a parallel SQLite backend with MarineISA, demonstrated its functionality, and is currently integrating MarineISA features into the primary MongoDB backend for frontend validation.

<product_requirements>
The application is a nautical AIS/NMEA data system designed for real-time streaming and storage of raw/decoded data in MongoDB, visualized on a  map. It supports TCP/UDP/Serial/file inputs and decodes AIS messages. Core features include historical position trails (color-coded by age, with directional arrows), a floating info panel (name, call sign, MMSI, country, spoof status, multiple sources), and a data source manager (add/disable/remove, Disable All). Search by MMSI, ship name, or call sign is supported. Base stations are blue squares, and VDO messages show pink range circles for own base stations, representing coverage to the furthest mobile vessel. Spoof limits (default 500km) gray out invalid targets. UI includes an app title, text colors, file upload progress, and a Search MMSI on VesselFinder button. A status panel with database stats and  export is present. Auto-centering on new targets was implemented but removed.

Recent feature additions include a vessel limiter (N most recent targets), plotting all target types (vessels, base stations, AtoNs with specific icons, multi-source base stations with asterisks), and a geographic filter (viewport, rectangle, whole world) for target rendering. An option to Keep non-vessel targets was added for stream limiting. Latest requirements mandated using course direction for invalid heading, a circle icon if both invalid, N/A for invalid headings (all target types), and a primitive airplane for SAR targets (Type 9 messages). Further requests included: making the only use last 500 messages limiter inactive by default (0/unlimited); a time slider in the MMSI panel to reverse time for selected and visible vessels, with interpolation and real position indicators; centering map view on search result clicks (without zoom); ensuring map clicks *only* select vessels (no pan/zoom); dynamic loading of trails for all vessels; a smaller title bar; a collapsible left menu (hidden by default, double arrows, no animation); geo-filter default to viewport, with only custom rectangle as another option; utilizing logged timestamps in file parsing; and integrating the MarineISA API for automatic vessel data enrichment with UI status indicators.

<code_architecture>
The application features a FastAPI (Python) backend and a React (JavaScript) frontend, originally utilizing MongoDB for data storage. A parallel SQLite backend was also introduced.



-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Main FastAPI application handling API routes, data processing, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Numerous updates for AIS message parsing (e.g., , handling invalid lat/lon, backfilling). Modified  export. Implemented target limiting and geographic filtering. Added specific fields to  model. Most recently, **MarineISA API integration** was added, including API key handling,  import, background enrichment queue, and new API endpoints (, ) to fetch and display enrichment status, and trigger priority enrichment.  was added to use message UTC seconds.  was added to handle logged timestamps in file uploads. The  in  model was defaulted to 0 (unlimited). SAR target identification was updated to treat all Type 9 messages as SAR.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Backend dependency management.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Added  and  for MarineISA integration.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: NEW file containing the client for MarineISA API interactions, including rate limiting and caching.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Environment variables for backend.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Added , , , .
-   **, , , **:
    -   **Purpose**: NEW directory and files for a parallel FastAPI backend using SQLite instead of MongoDB, also with MarineISA integration. This was created for testing the migration, but the main application still uses the MongoDB backend.
-   ****:
    -   **Purpose**: Main React component managing UI, state, and client-side logic.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Implemented helper functions for /, and new icons (AtoN, own/received base stations, generic circles, SAR airplane). Updated vessel and VDO marker rendering. Implemented UI controls for target limit, keep non-vessel targets, and geographic filtering. Auto-zoom for new sources was removed.  and  were added for performance. Trails loading was fixed.

        -   Display N/A for invalid headings for all target types in info panel.
        -   Modified  to center map without changing zoom on search result clicks, and no pan/zoom on map clicks.
        -   Implemented temporal playback (time slider UI, state variables, interpolation logic, temporal marker/trail rendering).
        -    was updated to dynamically load trails for new vessels in view.

- Fully implement the time slider feature for all visible vessels, including interpolation smoothness and greyed-out vessels without data in the time frame.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on integrating MarineISA API functionality into the **main MongoDB backend** (located at ). This was necessary because the frontend was still pointing to the MongoDB backend (port 8001), and the MarineISA enrichment endpoints had only been implemented in the parallel SQLite backend (port 8002).

The user reported Failed to trigger enrichment when attempting to use the MarineISA features from the frontend, prompting this shift in focus.

The AI engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Creating **: A new file for the MarineISA API client, handling requests, caching, and rate limiting.
2.  **Updating **: Adding  for asynchronous HTTP requests and  for environment variable management.
3.  **Updating **: Adding , , , and  for MarineISA configuration.
4.  **Modifying **:
    *   Importing  and .
    *   Initializing the  based on environment variables.
    *   Adding a global  and a background  to process vessel enrichment requests asynchronously.
    *   Adding new API endpoints:
        *   : To query the current MarineISA enrichment status for a given MMSI.
        *   : To manually trigger or prioritize MarineISA enrichment for a specific MMSI.
    *   Integrating calls to the  within the existing  function to automatically queue vessels for enrichment upon processing.
5.  **Restarting the MongoDB backend**: To apply all the new changes and activate the MarineISA integration.

The last message in the trajectory indicates that the MongoDB backend successfully restarted, and debug logs show MarineISA integration enabled multiple times. The next step is to test the newly implemented MarineISA endpoints and functionality on this main backend.

<optional_next_step>
Test the MarineISA integration on the main MongoDB backend by verifying the new enrichment status display and the refresh option in the frontend.
