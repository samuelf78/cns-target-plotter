The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive AIS/NMEA data streaming and mapping application from scratch, iteratively adding complex features. Initial development focused on core functionality: a React frontend with a nautical theme and a FastAPI backend with MongoDB storage. Key challenges included correctly handling  library usage, ensuring MongoDB ObjectId serialization, and establishing robust real-time data streaming (TCP/UDP/Serial) with WebSocket integration. The engineer adeptly incorporated advanced UI/UX elements using Shadcn UI, managed data sources, implemented historical tracking with visual trails, and introduced sophisticated spoof detection with per-source configurable limits. The process involved extensive debugging, particularly for stream handling, WebSocket communication, and database consistency. The project reached a mature state, but the most recent interaction highlighted an ongoing issue with VDO message processing and AIS Type 4 message handling, indicating a need for a deeper understanding of AIS data structures for accurate position storage.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a nautical-themed application to stream live or saved AIS/NMEA log files. Key features include:
- Storing raw/decoded data in MongoDB.
- Plotting data on a map (Google Maps, Google Earth, or similar, with user selection and custom map import options).
- Decoding raw AIS messages using , handling all message types based on MMSI, storing historical data (not just latest).
- Supporting data input via file upload, TCP/UDP sockets, and serial ports.
- Displaying historical trails of positions for clicked targets, colored by position count (Green >2, Orange/Yellow =2, Red =1).
- Showing directional arrows for targets based on heading.
- Popup with relevant info on map click, leading to all historical data on second click.
- Data Source Manager to add/disable/remove TCP/IP, UDP, Serial, and file sources.
- Disable All Sources button to clear all targets from the map.
- Real-time updates for TCP/IP streams.
- Floating info panel for highlighted target vessel.
- Searching MMSI list by MMSI, ship name, or call sign.
- Decoding ship type, MMSI country.
- Marking base stations/shore stations as blue squares.
- Listing all data sources for a vessel in the info window if multiple exist, and ensuring chronological order for multi-source trails.
- VDO message handling: plotting as blue squares, drawing pink range circles based on spoof limits and furthest VDM, greyed-out spoofed targets, per-source configurable spoof limits in kilometers.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's feedback that VDO messages were still not being handled, and thus VDO targets and cover circles were not plotted on the map. The engineer performed database checks and found no VDO or VDM positions, and in fact, no messages were being stored at all after a database clear. The AI engineer incorrectly concluded that AIS Type 4 (Base Station Report) messages do not contain position data, which led to the issue. The user corrected this assumption, stating, You are incorrect. Message 4 may contain position data. This indicates the current state is that the backend's  or related position storage logic needs to be updated to correctly extract and store position information from Type 4 AIS messages, which is crucial for VDO detection and plotting.
